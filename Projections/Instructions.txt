The following program is a rendering of different 4D regular polytopes projecting it in 3D.

We render all the regular polytopes and try to render an hypersphere, that fail in the conections, but is an interesting figure.

The figures can rotate in each plane of the 4D space. You can activate the rotation using the numerical keys, we have the following map:

1: Rotation around xy plane
2: Rotation around xz plane
3: Rotation around xw plane
4: Rotation around yz plane
5: Rotation around yw plane
6: Rotation around zw plane

Where we use the (x, y, z, w) notation in 4D. For example press 1 and 2 rotate the 4D figure in the planes xy and xz at the same time.

To switch the figure you can use the arrows, the change is cyclic.
You also can switch the projection methood, you can use de keys:

o: Orthographic
p: Perspective

Finally, you can set the distance of the camera in the perspective view using '+' and '-' keys to zoom out and zoom in respectively.
